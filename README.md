## Features
 ### Caching
 Permissions Handler uses the caching feature on two levels
 * **Database Cache**: <br>
 Permissions Handler uses the cache driver that configured in your `cache.php` file for caching user permissions, roles for 
configurable time.
 * **Annotation Cache**: <br>
 Because of parsing the files against the annotations is costy; permission Hander caches the parsed annotations to avoid 
parsing it again. by default this features is disabled in the development environment and enabled in the production. 
### [Gate](https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/authorization#gates) Integration
PermissionsHandler register users permissions into the `Gate`, so you can easly use laravel built in `can` method.
### Guard Support
PermissionsHandler doesn't depend on a specific model or guard, you can use whatever models or guards you need, 
PermissionsHandler will handle all.
### Seeder
If you enabled the `seeder` option from the `config/permissionsHandler.php` file then Permissions Handler will save each 
created permission, role and role-permissions to fils to be able to seed it again in later time or share them with others.
### Annotations
PermissionsHandler comes with an optinal awesome feature **Annotations**, it is based on Doctrine\Annotations. you can use it 
as the following:
```
use PermissionsHandler\Owns;
use PermissionsHandler\Roles;
use PermissionsHandler\Permissions;
.
.
.
/**
 * @Permissions({"add-posts"})
 */
function store(Request $request) {
    // your code here
}
/**
 * @Roles({"admin"})
 */
function delete(Request $request) {
    // your code here
}
 
/**
 * @Owns(relation="posts", parameter="id")
 */
function update(Request $request) {
    // your code here
}
```
As the above example, Permissions Handler comes with three types of annotations.
 * `Permissions({"perm1"})`: <br> only users that have *perm1* permission can access this method
 * `Roles({"role1"})`: <br> only users that have *role1* role can access this method
 * `Owns(relation="posts", parameter="id")`: <br> for example, if you are the owner of the post then only you whose can edit 
this post. `Owns` will ensure that, just pass the relation and the parameter which *PermissionsHandler* will get the value 
from the *Request* accordingly.
